#### **1. Two Modes of Thinking**

- **Focused Mode**
  - Uses familiar neural pathways.
  - Helps with **solving known problems** (e.g., multiplication, rhyming words).
  - Centered in the prefrontal cortex.
- **Diffuse Mode**
  - Allows **broad, creative thinking**.
  - Helps with **solving new or complex problems**.
  - Activated during **relaxed activities** (e.g., walking, showering, sleeping).
  - Used by **creative thinkers** to access deeper insights.
  - Salvador Dalí for example:
  ```
  Salvador Dalí, the famous surrealist painter, often used diffuse mode thinking to fuel his creativity. Diffuse mode is a relaxed, unconscious state of thinking that allows the brain to make unexpected connections, often leading to creative breakthroughs.

  Dalí developed a technique to deliberately enter diffuse mode thinking. He would sit in a chair holding a key in his hand, resting it over a metal plate on the floor. As he drifted into a light sleep (hypnagogia), his muscles relaxed, and the key would drop, making a loud noise that woke him up. In this brief half-dreaming state, Dalí would experience vivid, surreal images and unexpected associations, which he would later use in his paintings.
  ```

#### **2. Switching Between Modes for Better Learning**

- If stuck on a problem, **focus first**, then relax and let the diffuse mode work.
- Diffuse thinking happens **below conscious awareness**, so **taking breaks** helps.
- **Avoid procrastination**—waiting too long prevents the brain from processing information.

#### **3. The Pomodoro Technique to Overcome Procrastination**

- Why people procrastinate

  - When studying, the pain it triggers activates the part of the brain that processes "pain perception." The brain associates learning with pain, leading to a subconscious tendency to avoid studying. In this situation, scrolling on your phone becomes an easy way to escape discomfort. Plus, using your phone provides a temporary sense of pleasure, creating a cycle of continuous procrastination. 

    **open book** --> **feel pain** --> **YT/ IG/ TikTok** --> **feel relieved**

    However, research shows that once you start doing something you find unpleasant, the discomfort will fade shortly after. Therefore, the key is to use the Pomodoro technique to get yourself to take action.

- How to defeat Procrastination：

  - Pomodoro technique

    **25 minutes of focused work** → **Short mental break** → **Repeat**.

#### **4. Memory and Learning**

- Working memory (short-term):

  - Limited to **four slots**—information **disappears without repetition**.
  - Like a **blackboard** that easily erases information.
  - Need constant repetition to turn it into long-term memory 
    - use [Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) techniques, instead of repeating it 20 times a day.

- Long-term memory:

  - storage warehouse of memory 
  - Requires **practice and repetition** to transfer information.
  - **Spaced repetition** is key—don't cram everything in one day!
  - Learning over time builds strong neural structures, like muscles.

#### **5. Sleep and Exercise for Better Learning**

- Simply being awake causes the brain to accumulate a lot of toxic substances, which need to be cleared out through sleep.
- **Sleep** helps clear toxins from the brain and improves memory.
  - **Lack of sleep** impairs thinking, like **having poison in the brain**.
  - While sleeping, the brain forms neural connections based on what you learned today.
- **Exercise** boosts memory and learning ability.

### 6. Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

- How to learn boring things? Use aggressive learning by asking questions.
- Multitasking? Professors usually handle miscellaneous tasks in the morning so they can focus on their research in the afternoon.
- Environment matters: Research shows that environments allowing free movement and interaction with others improve learning outcomes. Studying alone at home has the worst effect. Exercise can have a similar benefit. Breaks during classes, where kids run around, are actually a way to enhance learning efficiency.
- Passion + persistence = the key to success. You don’t have to be "smart"!

#### **Key Takeaways for Effective Learning**

- **Alternate between focused and diffuse modes** to solve problems.
- **Use the Pomodoro technique** to stay productive and avoid procrastination.
- **Repeat and practice over time** to strengthen memory.
- **Get enough sleep and exercise** to improve brain function.
